## PyAutoGUI Teddy Bear Automation

This script uses PyAutoGUI to:
- Click into a Firefox browser window
- Type "teddy bear"
- Scroll down
- Capture a screenshot of the result

### Why This Exists
This was my first automation script. It helped me understand:
- GUI-based scripting
- Limitations of screen-coordinate automation
- Why browser automation requires more control
